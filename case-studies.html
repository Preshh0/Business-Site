								<strong>
									The Task:
								</strong>	
								<p>
									The aim of the campaign was to establish the company as the de-facto leader in the cement market. With the launch of another cement plant, it subtly shows the financial depth of the group, and builds the awareness to Ibese Plant project in an exciting fresh light, while exposing the falsehood on the financial challenges of the Dangote Group.
								</p>
								<strong>
									The Approach:
								</strong>	
								<p>
									A well-structured media/facility tour to the plant in Ogun State for key national media was organised.

The key messages at the briefing included; Group overview over the past years and growth pattern, more detailed overview of the Cement Division with targets and achievements, detailed overview of financing the cement division, loan and repayment. Key stakeholders like Bankers, national, state and local government, community leaders were invited.
								</p>
								<strong>
									The Result:
								</strong>	
								<p>
									All media platforms featured the expansion programme of the cement division of the Group highlighting the African and Nigerian angle, with endorsements from financial/government institutions, hence strengthening the reputation of Dangote Cement with solid financial strength in the wake of the financial and banking crisis.
