						<h2>TESTIMONIALS</h2>
					</header>
					<p>					
						“I worked with SY&T on the British Airways account for many years at senior management level. I found the team led by Mr. Simon Tumba, a very consummate aviator himself, very focused, dedicated and extremely result-oriented. On so many projects, they not only delivered on time, but also added creativity, strong energy and commitment – all these made them a very dependable partner for British Airways. I recommend them willingly without any hesitation to any organization that requires their services” - Kola Olayinka, Regional General Manager West Africa, 2010-2020 
						“The Media and Publicity unit in the Office of the Vice President worked briefly with SY&T under the leadership of Simon Tumba, on a communication project. We were pleased with the firm’s professional approach and remarkable performance. I recommend the media agency for similar assignments and projects”
